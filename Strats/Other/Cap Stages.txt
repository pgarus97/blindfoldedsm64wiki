Here you can find different strats for each star in the cap stages!
==Vanish Cap==
Description: Vanish Cap is the most useful of the 3 stages. Both the switch and the red coin star are doable with a little detour and are actively used in 70 star speedruns. The switch is located right at the end together with the red coin star, thus the strats are the same.

==Metal Cap==
Description: Not a really useful cap besides for a couple of stars in 120 Star. Red coins can be decently fast for anything above 70 Stars though and allow for some more options in stars.

==Wing Cap==
Description: Very fast and easy to activate the switch (really useful for close to all categories as well). Red Coins is probably the hardest star in the game though.
