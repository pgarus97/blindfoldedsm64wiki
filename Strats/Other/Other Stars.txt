Here you can find different strats for other stars in the game like Toad and MIPS!
==MIPS==
Description: Vanish Cap is the most useful of the 3 stages. Both the switch and the red coin star are doable with a little detour and are actively used in 70 star speedruns. The switch is located right at the end together with the red coin star, thus the strats are the same.

==Toad==
Description: Not a really useful cap besides for a couple of stars in 120 Star. Red coins can be decently fast for anything above 70 Stars though and allow for some more options in stars.
