==Seek the 8 Red Coins (BBH Reds)==
Description: Without being paired to 100 coins, this star is actually pretty okay. Still too slow to include in any category really.

==Big Boo's Balcony (BBH Balcony)==
Description: Another fast and reliable star. The vanish cap block can potentially be in your way dependent on your strat, so be careful about that!

==100 Coins==
Description: Quiet RNG dependent star, but actually really okay as there are plenty of coins in the course to collect. You should pair this one with BBH Merry as you get lots of coins from the ghosts in the basement.
