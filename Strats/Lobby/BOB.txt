Here you can find different strats for each star in Bob-Omb Battlefield (BOB)! 

== Big Bob-Omb on the Summit (BOB Boss) ==
Description: Usually first or second star in runs, needed to open the cannon. Most strats only differ in fighting the boss, but it can also be sped up by getting to the warp as fast as possible. There is ball RNG.

==Mario Wings to the Sky (BOB Secrets)==
Description: Incredibly difficult star, no matter the strategy. Can be made quiet fast but is risky to perform, with an overall success rate of around 50% for first try. Use at your own risk in runs.
