==Red Coins on the Ship Afloat (JRB Reds)==
Description: Very slow and tedious star, requires lot of individual setups for coins. Not too horrible if not paired with 100 coins though.

==100 Coins==
Description: One of the longest 100 coin stars in the game, requires lots of precision in swimming. Be careful as you can only miss 4 coins in the stage (total amount of coins: 104).
