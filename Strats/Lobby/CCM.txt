==Big Penguin Race (CCM BigPenguin)==
Description: One of the worst stars in the game as the currently only method to get it is a frame-perfect glitch to delay the penguin's textbox.

==Snowman's Lost His Head (CCM Head)==
Description: This star is only accessible after clearing every other star in the stage besides 100 coins. This make it only really worth it in longer categories as it requires the difficult CCM BigPenguin and CCM Reds.

==100 Coins ==
Description: Extremely difficult due to the slide part but manageable with lots of practice. Also really tight on coins so you should be careful with this star.
