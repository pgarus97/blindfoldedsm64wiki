Here you can find different strats for each star in Tall Tall Mountain (TTM)!
==Scale the Mountain! (TTM Top)==
Description: Fairly consistent star that is rather long, but can be optimized with lots of fast movement. Same route as TTM Waterfall, so you can use your strats for both stars.

==100 Coins==
Description: Interesting 100 coin star, as it has two possible beginnings: one from level start and one from the slide. Should probably be paired with reds, but it does not really matter.
